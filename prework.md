# Prework
### Tamba Bay/St. Pete Q1 2015

_JD Isaacks (jd@theironyard.com)_

We've got a lot to cover and only a few short weeks to do so. I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common starting point and spend class time focusing on things that are most difficult to learn on your own. That said, feel free to contact me with questions - learning how to ask for help is a very important skill.

## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **January 23th**. Any deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any questions, please email - I'll be glad to help (though expect some good-natured shaming if you're pushing the deadline).

## Setup

### Install OSX Yosemite (if you haven’t already)

* You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
* Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
* Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.

WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Install Google Chrome

  * [google.com/chrome](http://google.com/chrome)

### Install HipChat

  * [hipchat.com](https://www.hipchat.com/)

### Install a text editor

As a developer, you spend most of your time reading, writing, and editing code, so it's no surprise that a text editor is one the most important tools to familiarize yourself with.

I recommend and will be using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) but you may use any text editor you like.


## The Command Line

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to start getting comfortable.

* Install [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
* Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
* Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)


## Typing

Believe it or not, a **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/).)


## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Developers use such tools both to track their own work as it changes over time, and to collaborate with other developers on larger projects. I use Git on _every_ non-trivial project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Try Git course Github: [Try Git](https://try.github.com/)
2. If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.


## GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git repositories. We will be hosting all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center of your open-source world for some time to come. In many circles, your Github profile _is_ your resume, and it should be created with that in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - try to use a professional sounding username
2. Make sure to add a profile picture of yourself and use your real name (will help me remember who you are.)
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


## Reflection

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

1. Write up your reflections and send them to me via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflections throughout the course.
